In javascript you can not implement function overloading

function overloading - functions with same name and with diff signature
are implemented in a same scope.

In JS by default every function is variable argument function i.e. it can take 
0,1 or more than argument as well as same or diff type of arguments.

With every html element there is an event associated
e.g. button - click,focus,blur 
input type="text" - keypressed, mouseEnter,mouseLeave ,change
radio button, checkbox - change
dropdown - select

addEventListener is an API provided to any html element for handling events 
and it takes 3 arguments
1. name of event in string form 
2. listener name - this can be already existing functions or you can write anonymous function 
    as a listener 
3. event capture - boolean value - if false it is event bubbling and if true it is 
event capturing 

event bubbling - it is event occurs on child elements and get handled and it is passed to 
parent element and its handled there as well 

event capturing - event occured on child element and it is getting captured from parent element 
to child elements

AJAX - Asynchrnous javascript and xml - it is used to make HTTP requests to web server 
It is uses XMLHttpRequest object for making asynchrnous calls. 
Benefit of asynchrnous calls are we can fetch or post data to server without any interruption
to user. it increases performance of applications or web page 

XMLHttpRequest object has readyStates associated with state and those are 
0 - initialized
1 - loading 
2- loaded
3 - interactive 
4 - complete 


HTTP status codes 
100 - info 
200 - success 
300 - redirect
400 - client error 
500 - server error 


HTTP methods - POST, GET, DELETE, PUT 

USing all above concepts we r going to make AJAX call 
steps to make AJAX call are 
1. configure URL 
2. Create object of XMLHttpRequest
3. open request to web server 
4. send the request to server
5. check the status and depending on that get the response.

XMLHttpRequest object is used to exchange information with web server
